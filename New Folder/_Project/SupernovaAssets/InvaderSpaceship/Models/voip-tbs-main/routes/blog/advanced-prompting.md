# Advanced Prompting

## Creating Agents Easily

// If you are just getting started with creating agents using our services, the easiest way is to use our Easy Setup Wizard located on the [prompts page](https://gatewaycorporate.org/prompts) of your dashboard.

// In the Setup Wizard you can enter a name for both your agent and your business, set a personality and directives for your AI, and define a fallback emergency contact that the assistant can provide to the user if something goes wrong.

## Creating Prompts

// Each example prompt that you use to instruct your agent has an input and an output. The input for an example should represent a specific inquiry you may expect from your end user (e.g. "I would like to book an appointment" or "I would like a quote"). The output for each prompt should represent how you would generally like your agent to respond.
